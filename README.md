# password_gen
Generates passwords

This program creates a unique 14-character password using numbers & symbols every single time you run it through Python. I may expand on this in the future though feel free to use this code if you'd like. Saves me time from generating passwords through online websites which could phinish your data. Having a program on your own PC will significantly reduce a hacker from stealing your data. Stay safe out there!
